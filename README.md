# GP_VITEK_pdf_converter
Scrapes data from the pdf's outputted by Biomerieux's VITEK and compiles it into a usable csv.


Place all exported PDF's into one folder and use this script to turn them into a useable csv. This is specifically for the GP-ID (Gram positive ID card) VITEK card. The other information the script needs is what you want the output csv to be named and the filepath where you want it to go. Important to note, make sure your PDF's only have the first page with all of the test result info and name your PDF's as what isolate/strain your testing. The isolate column takes the information from what you name your file.
